# GitFetcher
A Godot addon that lets you download files from public GitHub repos into your Godot project in the editor.

Perfect when you reuse old files from past projects, you can just download them into your current Godot project without leaving Godot

# How To Format?
In the Owner section, write the repo's owner, for example, "SnapGamesStudio
In the Repo, write the repo's name, for example, "Gallery"
In the last section its already filled out with "main"; this is the branch of the repo you are going to download
